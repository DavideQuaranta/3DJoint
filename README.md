# 3DJoint_DataAnalysis

I changed the purpose of this repository since we decided to keep everything on Google Drive.
Maybe we'll use this space to make some tests on fitting algorithm and in general for data analysis until 
we have refined results and then upload on google drive only the the final results.
Anyway i'll put here the raw data we take in the lab as a backup.
